# Sandra-s-Weather-App
A simple Weather App built with HTML, CSS and pure Javascript.
# Inspiration:
I've done this simple app to strengthen my studies and my knowledge, and expecially to learn how to create a basic weather app.
I got inspired by looking at what's on the web, but in the end it's all my own work.
# What i've used:
There's only html, css and js, with a little bootstrap.
# Apis
The weather api come from https://openweathermap.org/
# PS:
The data received from api of Open Weather may not be accurate, sorry for this.
