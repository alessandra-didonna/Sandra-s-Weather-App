<h1>Sandra-s-Weather-App</h1>
A simple Weather App built with HTML, CSS and pure Javascript.
<h1>Inspiration:</h1>
I've done this simple app to strengthen my studies and my knowledge, and expecially to learn how to create a basic weather app.
I got inspired by looking at what's on the web, but in the end it's all my own work.
<h1>What i've used:</h1>
There's only html, css and js, with a little bootstrap.
